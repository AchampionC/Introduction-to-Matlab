  "content":"There are four problem sets, due daily. The first one will be released after the first class, and it will be due before the second class. The last problem set will be due before the last class. Problem set grading will be done coarsely (i.e. we will not penalize you for minor mistakes).\nAssignments Descriptions Additional Files Homework 1: Matrices and Vectors (PDF - 1.2MB)\nThis homework is designed to teach you to think in terms of matrices and vectors because this is how MATLAB organizes data. You will find that complicated operations can often be done with one or two lines of code if you use appropriate functions and have the data stored in an appropriate structure. The other purpose of this homework is to make you comfortable with using help to learn about new functions. The names of the functions you’ll need to look up are provided in bold where needed. Also, recall we cannot use space in the script’s name.\nNo additional files.\nHomework 2: Visualizing Data (PDF)\nThis homework is designed to give you practice with writing functions and visualizing data. This assignment will give you more freedom than Homework 1 to choose how you implement your functions. You will just be graded on whether your functions produce the correct output, but not necessarily on how efficiently they’re written. As before, the names of helpful functions are provided in bold where needed. Homework 2 Code (ZIP)\nThis file contains: 1 .pdf file and 4 .mat files.\nHomework 3: Problem Solving (PDF - 1.4MB)\nThis homework is designed to give you practice writing functions to solve problems. The problems in this homework are very common and you will surely encounter similar ones in your research or future classes. As before, the names of helpful functions are provided in bold where needed.\nHomework 3 Code (ZIP - 1.4MB)\nThis file contains: 1 .pdf file, 3 .mat files, and 6 .m files.\nHomework 4: Advanced Functionality (PDF)\nThis homework is designed to give you practice with more advanced and specific Matlab functionality, like advanced data structures, images, and animation. As before, the names of helpful functions are provided in bold where needed.\nHomework 4 Code (ZIP)\nThis file contains: 1 .pdf file and 1 .m file.\n"}
